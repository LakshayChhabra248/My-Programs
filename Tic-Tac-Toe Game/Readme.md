*   **Two Game Modes:**
    *   **Player vs Player:** Challenge your friends in a local head-to-head match.
    *   **Player vs Computer:** Test your skills against a formidable AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm.
*   **Intelligent AI:** The computer opponent uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, providing a real challenge even for experienced players.
*   **Clear Game Feedback:** See whose turn it is, who has won, or if the game is a draw with clear text messages.
*   **Easy New Game Setup:**  Start a new game with a single button click.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **Tkinter:** For the graphical user interface.
*   **Minimax Algorithm:** Implemented for the AI computer opponent.

## üí° Behind the Code

The `tictactoe.py` script is structured as follows:

*   **`TicTacToe` Class:** Manages the game logic and GUI.
*   **`button_click(self, index)`:** Handles user clicks and updates the game board.
*   **`check_winner(self)`:** Verifies win conditions and draw scenarios.
*    **`minimax(self, board, depth, is_maximizing)`**: Recursive implementation of the minimax Algorithm.
*    **`find_best_move(self)`:** Calls the minimax function and chooses the best move for computer.
*   **`computer_move(self)`:** Calls the computer's move using best move algorithm.
*   **`start_new_game(self)`:** Resets the game board for a new round.
*   **Game Modes:** Includes both single player (vs computer) and multi player.
